Once you have loaded up the app, please log in. This ensures that all features are available for you to enjoy.

First, you'll want to click on your username. Once there, you will be able to select your favorite Pokemon. This will be your avatar on our app and can be changed at any time. Keep an eye out on the color of the navigation bar if swap Pokemon!  

Next, please select "box", from this page you will see a list of all the pokemon you have created. First time here? well then it's time to create them! select "create new Pokemon" to do just that! 

Once here you have a few options. First, you can type in the name or Pokedex number of your favorite Pokemon. Currently we are limited to "Miraidon" #1008 however as more pokemon get released we'll ensure to keep the database updated. Unsure who you want to select? choose the "Random Pokemon" option and we'll choose a random Pokemon for you! Once you have created your Pokemon you'll return to the Box which will display every Pokemon you have created so far! Once you have selected a Pokemon, look out because there is a chance you will get a *shiny* suprise! 

Changed your mind on a Pokemon in your Box? Select "Release Pokemon" and we'll release your Pokemon back into the wild. 

Want more information on your Pokemon? Click on their sprite to be taken to their personal details paige. From here, you can see the typing, ability, item and base stats on the chosen Pokemon! If you look below the stats, you'll see that you have further options. To help plan your team and trully create your perfect Pokemon, you have the ability to give you Pokemon a nickname, change the held item and even choose one of the aplicable abilities from in game!  

Ready for battle? Head over to "View Teams" and select "Create New Team". This will take you to a page to first name your team, then set up your team ready to take on the Pokemon world. Click the edit button to select up to 6 Pokemon for your party by selecting their sprite. Be aware, that as these are unique Pokemon you can only add each individual to your party once. If you want a dream team of 6 Bulbasaur in your party (because who wouldn't?) make sure that you create 6 Bulbasaur on the Pokemon creation page. Once you click the sprite, they will be removed from the list of available Pokemon and will instead be moved below into your team so that you can see how they stack un, enabling you to truly create your dream team.
